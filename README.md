# On Call Status SPA with Vue.js

Working [demo](https://dkrautkramer.github.io/on-call-status/)

This is a demo of an on-call SPA that does the following: 
- shows a list of active on call users
- shows a list of all users and allows toggling on call status
- allows editing, adding, removing users
- shows a list of departments
- allows adding and removing of departments

The demo uses local storage to get/save any changes to users or departments mainly for demo purposes.
A default data set will be assigned if no local storage exists.

## Local Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification

```
